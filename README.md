First and foremost, thank you for taking the time to look at our project! This group project was our final for The Midland Code Academy to show off our newly gained knowledge and skills developed in the program. We hope you enjoy playing our game Spy Code that we have worked very hard on
Game Rules
Teams
Codenames is a game for two teams. There is a grid of 16 words. There are:

6 red cards
6 blue cards
3 neutral cards
1 bomb.
Each team has one SpyMaster and one Operative, and only Spymasters see which cards belonging to which teams.

Spymasters take turns giving clues to their teammates (Operatives) based on the words that appear on the card, trying to lead them to guessing their teams' cards. The team that guesses all their cards first wins the game.


Giving Clues
When it's the SpyMasters turn to give a clue, type in a one word clue that relates to one or all of your teams colored cards. Your Operatives will only see the clue provided and the 16 cards with the words provided. Watch out for the bomb card, it's an automatic game over! Avoid clues that would lead to the bomb or to the other team's cards. Note: Some clues are not allowed, for example using any words provided on the cards, cannot be used.

Guessing
Operatives guess the cards based on their Spymaster's clue. You get up to 3 correct guesses for each clue per team turn. To make your guess official, select the card. The game will then reveal the color of the chosen card, upon hitting submit. If you choose the oposing teams card your teams turn is over. On your teams next turn the SpyMaster will give a new clue. Notes: Remember clues from previous turns. Pay attention to opposing teams clues.

End of Turn
Your turn can end in one of three ways: Guessing a word of the opponent's color or neutral color. End guessing manually by clicking End Turn. Your turn ends upon 3 successful guesses.

Winning and Losing
Teams alternate turns. A team wins once all their cards have been guessed. They lose if they guess the bomb or the other team successfully guesses all of their cards first!

Valid Clues
The clue is strictly limited to one word. The Spymaster is expected to keep a straight face and they shouldn't comment on players' guesses, to avoid giving up any unwanted information. Your clue is supposed to be a single word, but Spymasters can agree on more flexible rules. For example, you can agree to allow two-word clue, like NEW YORK. Give clues in the language you have agreed on. Don't use foreign words to give extra information. Don't give clues about the letters/length in the word or its position in the grid. Keep your clues in the spirit of the game, and if you aren't sure, ask the opposing Spymaster (using some form of communication that the other players can't hear or see). You can end turn without a guess for first and/or second guess. However, a quess is required to finish your teams' turn. Or you can make a quess on the first and/or second and end your teams' turn on the third without a guess.
